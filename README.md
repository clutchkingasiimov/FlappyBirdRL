# FlappyBirdRL
This is the implementation of Text FlappyBird using Reinforcement Learning. The models that have been implemented are Q-learning and SARSA. 

## Folders 
#### agents
Containts Q-learning, SARSA and their training module

#### Datasets 
Contains the saved Q-table and parameter sweeps

#### Plots
the plots made for the Q-table and various parameter sweeps

## How to Run:

Run the `main.py` file for the agents to start training. The agents are initialized at a dafault value of 8000 episodes to train on.
